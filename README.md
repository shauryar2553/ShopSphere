Hey! This is an e-commerce website I built as part of my college project. It’s made using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), and I’ve added features like product management, secure login, Stripe payment integration, and a shopping cart system.

Key Features:
-   🚀 Project Setup
-   🗄️ MongoDB & Redis Integration
-   💳 Stripe Payment Setup
-   🔐 Robust Authentication System
-   🔑 JWT with Refresh/Access Tokens
-   📝 User Signup & Login
-   🛒 E-Commerce Core
-   📦 Product & Category Management
-   🛍️ Shopping Cart Functionality
-   💰 Checkout with Stripe
-   🏷️ Coupon Code System
-   👑 Admin Dashboard
-   📊 Sales Analytics
-   🎨 Design with Tailwind
-   🛒 Cart & Checkout Process
-   🔒 Security
-   🛡️ Data Protection
-   🚀Caching with Redis
-   ⌛ And a lot more...

This project was a great way for me to learn how to build a full-stack e-commerce app. I got hands-on experience with JWT authentication, Stripe payments, and managing data with MongoDB. It was a lot of fun and helped me understand how to connect the front-end with the back-end.

This project is open-source, so feel free to check it out, fork it, and make improvements! 😊
